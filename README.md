## Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) Implementation
This project presents an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) implemented from scratch. The model has been thoroughly tested using a toy problem as well as with real-world feature sets to evaluate its performance. Below are the key details of the project and its evaluation:

### Toy Problem: Sinusoidal Dataset
The first step in testing the ELM involved using a small toy problem where the dataset consisted of points from a sine wave. The task was to evaluate if the ELM could accurately predict the values based on the input features derived from the sine function.

### Feature Set and Model Evaluation
For the initial experiments, we trained the model on 7 important features extracted from the data. After achieving satisfactory results, we expanded the feature set to include 25 features.

### Performance Metrics
F1 Score: 0.99
Accuracy: 0.99
These results show that the ELM model has achieved near-perfect performance, correctly classifying both cycling and failure states with high accuracy and precision.

### Model Characteristics
Classification: The model is capable of identifying and classifying two key states: cycling and failure.
Implementation: The ELM was implemented from scratch, ensuring full control over the architecture and parameters.
Conclusion
The ELM demonstrates strong performance, achieving high accuracy and F1 score even on a toy problem. Its ability to classify complex datasets with high precision makes it suitable for various applications.
